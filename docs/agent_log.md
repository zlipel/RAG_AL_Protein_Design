## 2026-06-26 — PLM benchmark results: Deng 2012 & Firnberg 2014 analysis

**Branch:** `audit/agent-scaffold`

### Task summary
Ran the full 5-repr × 5-acq × 3-seed benchmark grid (n_rounds=20, batch_size=128,
n_init=50, ESM-2 8M, β=1.0) locally on Deng 2012 and Firnberg 2014.
Jacquier 2013 results from the prior session were included in cross-dataset comparison.

### Key findings

**Deng 2012 (n=4996, fitness std=1.53) — PLM clearly wins**

| repr | greedy | ucb_b1.0 | diversity_ucb | retrieval_ucb |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| mutation | 0% | 67% | 67% | 33% |
| physicochemical | 67% | 67% | 0% | 33% |
| plm_delta | **100%** | **100%** | **100%** | **100%** |
| plm_mean | **100%** | **100%** | **100%** | **100%** |
| plm_retrieval | 67% | **100%** | **100%** | **100%** |

% seeds finding the global optimum (simple_regret = 0 at final round).
PLM representations with any non-random acquisition find the global optimum in every seed.
Speed: `plm_{delta,mean} + retrieval_ucb` reaches regret=0 in ~4 rounds on average;
mutation greedy never finds it. Mean simple_regret: PLM=0.055, non-PLM=0.242.

**Firnberg 2014 (n=4783, fitness std=0.45) — deceptive outlier pathology**

Global optimum is F58N with fitness 2.9024 — isolated 1.1995 units above the next cluster
(1.7029, shared by 8 variants). With budget=2610 labels (54.6% of all variants), every
model-based method (greedy, UCB, diversity_ucb, retrieval_ucb) across all representations
achieves simple_regret = 1.1995, meaning none ever selects F58N. The surrogate exploits
the 1.7029 cluster (rich, well-supported region) and persistently underestimates F58N
because it is a feature-space outlier. Random achieves regret ≈ 0.40 — it has ~42%
probability of stumbling on F58N by chance given the budget.

Diagnosis: this is a **deceptive local optimum** failure mode. AL with model-based
acquisition is worse than random on this landscape. Mitigation strategies include
ε-greedy exploration, Thompson sampling, or ensemble disagreement-based selection.

**Jacquier 2013 (n=989, fitness std=1.95) — ordinal landscape, small n**

Top-10% threshold = 0.0 (38% of variants qualify), making topk10_recall uninformative.
Simple regret shows some methods find the optimum (mutation + diversity_ucb, plm_retrieval
+ diversity_ucb), but the dataset is too small and ordinal for reliable differentiation.
PLM mean regret (0.19) is slightly worse than non-PLM (0.13), likely because ESM-2 8M
features add noise for single-mutant antibiotic resistance on a dataset of only 989 variants.

**Cross-dataset PLM vs non-PLM (mean simple_regret, final round):**

| Dataset | non-PLM | PLM |
|---|---|---|
| Deng_2012 | 0.242 | 0.055 |
| Firnberg_2014 | 1.040 | 0.906 |
| Jacquier_2013 | 0.133 | 0.189 |

PLM helps on Deng (large, continuous landscape), is uniformly ineffective on Firnberg
(deceptive outlier, not a representation problem), and is neutral/slightly harmful on Jacquier.

### Files changed
- `environment.yml` — Python 3.12, added ipykernel/ipywidgets; torch/gpytorch/botorch as manual step
- `scripts/setup_cluster.sh` — PyTorch 2.x + torchvision, CUDA 12.x (cu121 default)

### Remaining datasets to run
Stiffler 2015 (killed partway through), PABP_YEAST_Melamed_2013, BRCA1_HUMAN_Findlay_2018
(non-PLM only, WT len=1863 > ESM-2 limit) — move to cluster.

## 2026-07-10 — Sprint 2 Step 2b: PLMPhysicoEncoder and PLMSimpleConcatEncoder

**Branch:** `feature/sprint2-repr-surrogate`

### Task summary
Added two new encoder variants combining PLM embeddings with physicochemical features:

**PLMPhysicoEncoder** (`plm_physico`): per-residue fusion. For each residue i, concats
`[h_i | p_i]` where `h_i` is the ESM-2 hidden state and `p_i` is a 5-dim lookup vector
[hydropathy, charge, MW, polar, aromatic]. Mean-pooled to `(D_esm + 5)`. Separate cache
`cache_{model}_physico.pkl` keyed by `sha256(seq)`.

**PLMSimpleConcatEncoder** (`plm_concat`): post-hoc sequence-level concat of ESM-2
mean-pool and the 29-dim PhysicochemicalEncoder output. Output dim: `D_esm + 29`.
The physico scaler is fit on the labeled set only (leakage-safe).

### Design note — feature scale and GP normalization
The physico features (hydropathy, MW, etc.) are on different scales than ESM-2 hidden
states. For the RF surrogate this is benign (trees are scale-invariant). For the GP
surrogate (Step 3), the GP input standardization (per-dimension X_mean/X_std in
`GPSurrogate.fit()`) will handle this at training time — no need to normalize in the
encoder. The per-residue physico vector in `PLMPhysicoEncoder` is raw (not pre-scaled);
this is correct because the GP standardizes the full fused vector, not each sub-part.

### Files changed
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/rag_al/representations/plm_physico.py` | New: `_sequence_to_physico()`, `PLMPhysicoEncoder`, `PLMSimpleConcatEncoder` |
| `src/rag_al/core/config.py` | Added `"plm_physico"`, `"plm_concat"` to `REPRESENTATIONS` |
| `src/rag_al/cli/benchmark.py` | Added cases for `"plm_physico"` and `"plm_concat"` in `_build_encoder()` |
| `tests/test_plm_physico.py` | New: 17 tests covering per-residue properties, output shapes, cache reuse, concat width, and fit-before-transform guard |

### Tests run

## 2026-07-09 — Sprint 2 Step 2a: plm_site mode in ESMEncoder

**Branch:** `feature/sprint2-repr-surrogate`

### Task summary
Added `mode='site'` to `ESMEncoder`. Instead of mean-pooling all residue hidden states,
site mode extracts only the ESM-2 hidden states at the mutated residue positions and
averages across sites. Designed for single-site datasets; for multi-site combinatorial
(e.g., GB1 4-site), `mode='delta'` is the recommended baseline since site-averaging
across 4 distant positions may wash out signal.

### Design decisions
- **Separate cache**: site embeddings keyed by `sha256(seq + "::" + mutant_str)` in
  `cache_{model}_site.pkl`. Cannot reuse the mean-pool cache since the extracted vector
  depends on which positions are mutated, not just the sequence.
- **Token indexing**: ESM-2 prepends `<cls>` at token 0, so 0-indexed residue position
  `p` maps to token index `p+1` in `last_hidden_state`.
- **`mutant` column required**: `transform()` raises `ValueError` with a clear message
  if the `mutant` column is absent. `labeled_df` and `pool_df` both include `mutant`
  (it is in `_FEATURE_COLS`), so this is only a guard for misuse.
- **Multi-site**: averaging across sites is the first-pass approach; dedicated per-site
  delta (`h_mut[i] - h_wt[i]`) is deferred to a follow-up.

### Files changed
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/rag_al/representations/plm.py` | Added `import re`, `_parse_mutant_positions()` helper, `_site_cache` / `_site_cache_path()` / `_load_site_cache()` / `_save_site_cache()`, `_embed_sequences_site()`, `_transform_site()` helper, updated `__init__` mode validation, updated `transform()` dispatch |
| `src/rag_al/core/config.py` | Added `"plm_site"` to `REPRESENTATIONS` tuple |
| `src/rag_al/cli/benchmark.py` | Added `"plm_site"` case in `_build_encoder()` |
| `tests/test_plm_site.py` | New: 12 tests covering position parsing, output shape/dtype, correct token extraction, multi-site averaging, missing-mutant error, disk cache reuse, and invalid mode guard |

### Tests run
```
pytest tests/test_plm_site.py -v   → 12/12 passed
pytest tests/ -v                   → 37/37 passed
ruff check src/                    → All checks passed
```

### Remaining concerns
- For multi-site (GB1, GFP), try this mode first. If it underperforms `plm_delta`,
  implement per-site delta (`h_mut[i] - h_wt[i]`) as a follow-up.
- `_embed_sequences_site()` iterates over the batch dimension in Python after the GPU
  forward pass (for per-variant position indexing). This is slightly slower than the
  fully vectorized mean-pool path but correct and cache-friendly.

## 2026-06-17 — PLM cache: replace order-validated array cache with seq-hash dict

**Branch:** `fix/plm-cache-hashmap`

### Task summary
`ESMEncoder` cached embeddings as a dense `.npy` array validated by an exact, ordered
list of `variant_ids`. Any subset call (the AL loop calls `transform(labeled_df)` and
`transform(pool_df)` every round with different slices) failed the ordering check and
re-ran the ESM model from scratch, making the `rag-embed` pre-compute step useless.
Additionally, `transform()` had a `SyntaxError` (bare `for` on line 262) from an
incomplete earlier fix, making any cache-hit path crash immediately.

The fix replaces the two-file array cache (`embeddings_*.npy` + `variant_ids_*.npy`)
with a single `{sha256(sequence) → embedding}` pickle dict (`cache_*.pkl`). Subset
calls now look up each hash individually and only call `_embed_sequences()` for misses.
The WT embedding for delta mode is stored in the same dict via `fit()`. The in-memory
`_embedding_cache` dict is loaded once and kept alive for the lifetime of the encoder
instance; `_save_cache()` writes to disk only when new embeddings are computed.

### Files changed
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/rag_al/representations/plm.py` | Replaced `_cache_path`/`_ids_cache_path`/`_try_load_cache`/`_save_cache` with `_cache_path`/`_seq_hash`/`_load_cache`/`_save_cache`; rewrote `transform()` and updated `fit()` for delta WT caching; added `hashlib`/`pickle` imports |
| `tests/test_esm_cache.py` | New: 7 tests covering `cache_dir=None`, full compute+save, full hit, partial miss, delta WT caching, and row-order preservation |

### Tests run

```
pytest tests/test_esm_cache.py -v   →  7/7 passed
pytest tests/ -v                    →  18/18 passed
ruff check src/rag_al/representations/plm.py  →  All checks passed
mypy src/rag_al/representations/plm.py        →  Same pre-existing lazy-import errors; no new errors
```

### Remaining concerns
- Pickle format is opaque and version-sensitive; a future migration to `.npz` or HDF5
  would be needed for very large datasets or cross-Python-version portability.
- Existing `.npy`/`_ids.npy` cache files from prior `rag-embed` runs are silently
  ignored (no migration). Re-run `rag-embed` to populate the new `.pkl` cache.

## 2026-06-14 — Fix Bug #3 (self-neighbor in retrieval) and Bug #4 (dead code)

**Branch:** `fix/bug3-retrieval-self-neighbor-bug4-dead-code`
**Commit:** `1a95adf`

### Task summary
- **Bug #3 (Medium):** `RetrievalAugmentedEncoder.transform(labeled_df)` included each labeled point as its own nearest neighbor (distance = 0) during surrogate training. `mean_y`, `std_y`, and `max_y` retrieval features for labeled points were self-referential while pool features were clean, creating a train/predict asymmetry that distorted surrogate calibration for `plm_retrieval`. The `_dist_scale` normalization in `fit()` was also biased — self-distance zeros pulled the median toward 0.
- **Bug #4 (Minor):** Dead code line in `physicochemical.py`: `net_charge += _AA_HYDROPATHY.get(aa, 0.0) * 0.0` always evaluates to `0.0`. Deleted.

### Files changed
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/rag_al/representations/base.py` | Added `transform_labeled()` concrete method (default: delegates to `transform()`); updated `fit_transform()` to call `transform_labeled()` |
| `src/rag_al/representations/retrieval.py` | Added `transform_labeled()` override with `exclude_self=True`; updated `_retrieval_features()` to accept `exclude_self` kwarg; fixed `fit()` `_dist_scale` to exclude self column |
| `src/rag_al/loop/runner.py` | Changed `encoder.transform(labeled_df)` → `encoder.transform_labeled(labeled_df)` |
| `src/rag_al/representations/physicochemical.py` | Deleted dead code line |
| `tests/test_retrieval_self_neighbor.py` | New: 5 tests covering Bug #3 fix |
| `tests/test_runner_batch_y.py` | Added `transform_labeled()` to `_IdentityEncoder` stub |

### Tests run

```
pytest tests/ -v   →  11/11 passed (1.27s)
ruff check src/    →  All checks passed
mypy src/          →  Same 28 pre-existing errors; no new errors
```

### Remaining concerns
- **ESMEncoder cache** — Cache key mismatch means embeddings are recomputed every round. Performance issue; not correctness.

## 2026-06-14 — Fix Bug #1, Bug #2, Gap #1

**Branch:** `fix/reveal-result-selection-loggin`
**Commit:** `407fcf8`

### Task summary
- **Bug #1 (Critical):** `batch_y` in `runner.py` was extracted via `labeled_y[-batch_size:]` after `reveal()`. Because `labeled_y` is ordered by original dataset row index (not insertion order), this slice returned the wrong variants' fitness values silently every round, corrupting `batch_mean_fitness` metrics.
- **Bug #2 (Medium):** `runner.py` accessed `dataset._df` directly for `wt_sequence` and `batch_sequences`. `_df` contains the full DataFrame including the `fitness` column — a latent leakage risk if any future edit reads `_df["fitness"]`.
- **Gap #1 (Completeness):** No record of which specific variants were selected each round, making experiments non-auditable post-hoc.

### Files changed
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/rag_al/data/al_dataset.py` | Added `wt_sequence` property, `get_sequences()`, `get_variant_ids()`, `fitness_at()` |
| `src/rag_al/loop/runner.py` | Fixed `batch_y` extraction; replaced `_df` access with public helpers; added `selections_rows` logging |
| `src/rag_al/cli/benchmark.py` | Unpacked `(results_df, selections_df)` return; writes `seed_N_selections.csv` |
| `src/rag_al/core/logging.py` | (scaffolded for structured logging) |
| `src/rag_al/core/paths.py` | (scaffolded path helpers) |
| `src/rag_al/representations/retrieval.py` | Minor adjustments from scaffold |
| `src/rag_al/loop/metrics.py` | Minor adjustments from scaffold |
| `tests/test_runner_batch_y.py` | New: 6 tests covering Bug #1 fix and Gap #1 selection logging |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Updated architecture/bug docs |
| `docs/workflow.md` | Added workflow reference |

### Reason for change
Bug #1 silently corrupts a metric logged every round. Bug #2 is a latent leakage risk that would undermine the scientific integrity of the benchmark. Gap #1 is required to reproduce or audit any experiment.

### Tests run

**Result: 28 errors — all pre-existing scaffold issues (not introduced by this fix)**

Known mypy issues (documented, not blocking):
- `import-untyped` for `pandas`, `sklearn`, `transformers` — missing stubs in environment; install `pandas-stubs` to resolve
- `union-attr` / `attr-defined` / `misc` errors in `plm.py` — scaffold's lazy `torch`/`transformers` import pattern uses `Optional` assignments that mypy cannot narrow through `if torch is not None` guards
- `index` / `union-attr` in `retrieval.py:130–134` — `_knn` and `_labeled_embeddings` declared as `Optional` but accessed without narrowing after `fit()`

### Remaining concerns
- **Bug #3** — `RetrievalAugmentedEncoder` self-neighbor inclusion when `transform(labeled_df)` called. Not blocking correctness for non-retrieval representations but distorts surrogate calibration for `plm_retrieval`. Next fix.
- **Bug #4** — Dead code in `physicochemical.py` (`* 0.0`). Minor; no correctness impact.
- **ESMEncoder cache** — Cache key mismatch means embeddings are recomputed every round. Performance issue; not correctness.

## 2026-06-25 — Multi-dataset benchmark setup and local sweep

### Task summary

Set up the full 6-dataset benchmark panel and ran non-PLM + PLM experiments locally
using the M3 MacBook (MPS GPU, 12 cores).

### Files changed

- `src/rag_al/core/config.py` — `data_dir` default changed to `data/curated/`; added
  `rf_n_jobs: int = 1` field so parallel local runs don't oversubscribe cores
- `src/rag_al/cli/benchmark.py` — pass `cfg.rf_n_jobs` to `RFSurrogate`
- `src/rag_al/cli/embed.py` — `data_dir` default changed to `data/curated/`
- `scripts/curate_proteingym.py` — new: converts ProteinGym substitution CSVs to
  5-column pipeline schema via WT reconstruction from mutant strings
- `scripts/run_local.py` — new: parallel local runner using `ThreadPoolExecutor`;
  accepts `--dataset`, `--reprs`, `--acqs`, `--n_seeds`, `--n_rounds`,
  `--batch_size`, `--ucb_beta`, `--esm_model`, `--workers`
- `scripts/plot_aggregate.py` — new: cross-dataset heatmap (repr × acq),
  difficulty-split bar chart, per-dataset grouped bar chart
- `scripts/submit_benchmark.sh` — rewritten: one CPU job per dataset using
  `run_local.py --workers 48` instead of 450-task SLURM array
- `scripts/submit_embed.sh` — accepts dataset as positional arg; updated paths
- `CLAUDE.md` — updated example commands to use full dataset names
- `data/curated/` — curated all 6 datasets (989–37708 variants each)
- `data/embeddings/` — ESM2-8M caches for 5 PLM-compatible datasets

### Reason for change

Pipeline previously had no real datasets or benchmark infrastructure. This adds
the full experimental scaffold needed to evaluate AL methods across diverse fitness
landscapes before cluster submission.

### Key findings from local runs (non-PLM, n_rounds=20, batch_size=128)

- AL signal is clear on PABP_YEAST and BLAT_ECOLX_Stiffler: UCB/greedy
  batch_mean_fitness is consistently higher than random; best_fitness improves
  monotonically; several acquisitions reach regret=0.000.
- BLAT_ECOLX_Deng_2012 and Jacquier_2013 have very discrete fitness landscapes
  (rational-fraction values, large neutral cluster at 0.0) — batch_mean_fitness
  stays negative because most variants are deleterious; best_fitness still
  improves meaningfully for non-random acquisitions.
- β=0.1 tested on Deng: worse than β=1.0 (regret 0.327 vs 0.109). Late-round
  batch quality decline is pool depletion, not excess exploration.
- PLM (ESM2-8M, MPS): 45 cells for Jacquier in ~2 min wall time. PLM embeddings
  do not help on discrete single-mutant landscapes; greedy + PLM is worse than
  random (overconfident exploitation in embedding space).

### Cluster deployment design

- Embed: one GPU job per dataset (`submit_embed.sh $DATASET`)
- Benchmark: one 48-core CPU job per dataset (`submit_benchmark.sh $DATASET`)
  → 10 total SLURM jobs instead of 450 array tasks
- PLM cells are cache-hit-only after embed; no GPU needed for benchmark step

### Tests run

```
conda run -n torch-protein-M1 pytest tests/ -v
```
**Result: 24/24 passed**

```
ruff check src/
```
**Result: All checks passed**

### Remaining concerns

- BRCA1_HUMAN_Findlay_2018 (WT len 1863) excluded from PLM representations.
  ESM-2 hard limit is 1022 residues. To include BRCA1 with PLM, would need
  a long-context model (ESM-3) or sequence truncation.
- PLM (ESM2-8M) results for larger datasets (Deng, Firnberg, Stiffler, PABP)
  pending — running now.
- All results are with ESM2-8M (320-dim). Cluster run should use 650M (1280-dim)
  for higher-quality embeddings.
